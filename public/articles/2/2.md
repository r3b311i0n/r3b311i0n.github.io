## Font Compression

I've been going a bit mental ðŸ˜µ in regards to fonts recently, and I think web-fonts or font compression for use on the web is essential for anyone serious about web development.

## WOFF2

[WOFF2][woff] or **W**eb **O**pen **F**ont **F**ormat **2** is the second iteration of the web-font format. The [WOFF][woff] formats compress your desired [TTF][ttf] and [OTF][otf] fonts to be efficiently used on the web.

### WOFF vs WOFF2

 * WOFF uses [zlib][zlib] for compression while WOFF2 uses [Brotli][brotli] for compression.

 * WOFF grants a >40% reduction to file size vs traditional TTF while WOFF2 grants a >30% reduction to file size vs WOFF.

 * Support:

    * WOFF
        * Firefox >= 3.6
        * Chrome >= 6.0
        * Internet Explorer >= 9
        * Edge
        * Opera >= 11.10
        * Safari >= 5.1

    * WOFF2
        * Firefox >= 35
        * Chrome >= 36
        * Internet Explorer >= 9
        * Edge >= 14
        * Opera >= 26
        * Safari >= 10

## Compress to WOFF2

Grab the source from [here][woff2-src] and install it. Note that compilation requires [GCC][gcc]. Afterwards, you get two command **woff2_compress** and **woff2_decompress**. Both commands take one argument each; use woff2_compress to compress a [TTF][ttf] or [OTF][otf] file to [WOFF2][woff] or use woff2_decompress to decompress a [WOFF2][woff] file to its original format (OTF/TTF).

```
woff2_compress font.otf
```

```
woff2_decompress font.woff2
```

And there you have it. Simple and effective. Happy coding! ðŸ™ŒðŸŽ‰
